  <h2>My adventure so far...</h2>
  <p>So while I haven't been able to do a lot of storm spotting (or chasing) yet.
  I still have been doing a lot of work. I take pictures of lightning and storms that come my way and
  while that doesn't happen a lot where I live I still get quite a few good pictures!
  For example, here is one I took last year of a sweet lightning strike in the clouds!</p>

  <h2>My First Chase</h2>
  <p>I went on my first "chase" it wasn't much. I didn't see any lightning, tornadoes, or hail. So that was kinda lame.
  I did get some cool pictures of some clouds though!</p>
