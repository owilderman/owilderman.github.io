  <h2>My adventure so far...</h2>
  <p>So while I haven't been able to do a lot of storm spotting (or chasing) yet.
  I still have been doing a lot of work. I take pictures of lightning and storms that come my way and
  while that doesn't happen a lot where I live I still get quite a few good pictures!
  For example, here is one I took last year of a sweet lightning strike in the clouds!</p>

  <h2>What I'm doing now...</h2>
  <p>Once I have a job, have a car, and am able to drive I plan on getting a subaru forester. The 2010 model to be exact,
    I plan on putting in custom horns and tripods for cameras. I also want to put bulletproof glass for the windows and windshield.
  This will protect from hail, debris, and rocks that may hit my car.</p>
  <p>It's gonna be pretty sick!</p>
  <h2>My gear</h2>
  <p>So right now my current setup consists of my phone. I use the Iphone Xr, it's actually the exact phone I used take that photo of lightning in the clouds!
  My current computer is a Lenovo Ideapad 300. It's the best but its not the worst either. The battery life is drained but I don't really mind.
  It has an ssd and 4gb of ram but I'm upgrading to 16gb soon. I really like it but might upgrade it soon It will work for what I need though.
  Sorry enough computer talk! Let's get back to the gear. My weather radio is the Eton FRX1 weather radio. It's a hand crank radio but it also has
  AM/FM radio and a micro-usb charging cable if I want to charge it with a cord. Very helpful for emergencies and finding my way in the dark.</p>
  <h2>The steps ahead...</h2>
  <p>So right now I still need a camera and a car. I found a decent dslr camera on amazon with the right lense I need for about $600 dollars. As I have said before the car I want is a Subaru forester. I can usually get one of those for about $6000. With the job I have lined up I can get $12,000 a year. This would leave almost half of that for other upgrades like new lenses, windsheilds (I hear those break a lot when storm chasing!), Spotify (because spotify is a requirement), and many other things like food and gas. Hopefully I will have most of that by sometime in 2022 (if not 2021!). I think I want to get the camera first that way I can work with what I got right now and seeing as it is only $600 it seems kinda worth it to start taking professional photos this spring and summer when the storms start rolling in where I live.
    this will leave plenty of time for me to get enough money for a car so I can start going further than my hometown for awesome storms.</p>
  <h2>Taking a step...</h2>
  <p>Alright, So I have a job now! $11.00 an hour pumpin gas! So in one year I'll make $12,000. This leaves plenty of money to buy all the junk I need!</p>
  <p>I will continue to keep this page updated as I buy more camera gear and go on more photo shoots. Stay Tuned!</p>
