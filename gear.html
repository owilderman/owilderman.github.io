    <h2>My Loadout</h2>
    <h3>My Computer</h3>
    <p>So I use a lot of different things everyday, so here is my loadout, My computer is a 2012 MacBook Pro, with 240gb of storage, and 8gb of ram.
      Running macOS Monterey through a patcher, it's kinda slow but it runs. I am considering upgrading to one of the new 14" M1 Pro Macbooks. Though a 13" M1 would be plenty
    for my workload. </p>
    <h3>My Phone</h3>
    <p>My phone is the 128gb model of the the iPhone Xr. I love this thing,
      it's got great battery life letting me use it all day without charging
      it as long as I plug it in before I go to bed. Plus it's strong enough so that I dont have to use a case with out it breaking.
    </p>
    <h3>My Headphones</h3>
    <p>My daily driver headphones are the Airpods Pro. Love these things! The noise cancellation is great and the sound quality is amazing.</p>
    <h3>My Watch</h3>
    <p>As I use both Airpods, an iPhone, and a Macbook Pro, what watch do you think I use? That's right I use the Apple Watch Series 3.
    I love being able to track my movement, answer calls and texts, and so much more from the ease of my watch.</p>
    <h2>Storm Spotting</h2>
    <h3>My Camera</h3>
    <p>For my camera I use my mom's old Canon EOS 7D. Like I said it's pretty old but it's still really good.
    The pictures on my Storm Spotting page were taken with that camera.</p>
    <h3>Other Camera Gear</h3>
    <p>My tripod is well... a tripod. I don't know the brand or the price of it but its still a decent one.
    That's pretty much it.</p>
