    <h2>My Loadout</h2>
    <h3>My Computer</h3>
    <p>So I use a lot of different things everyday, so here is my loadout, My computer is a Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon G2. With 240gbs of storage and 8gbs of ram
    this thing does the trick for now. No need to upgrade anytime soon. </p>
    <h3>My Phone</h3>
    <p>My phone is the 128gb model of the the iPhone 13 Pro. I love this thing,
      it's got great battery life letting me use it all day without charging
      it as long as I plug it in before I go to bed.
    </p>
    <h3>My Headphones</h3>
    <p>My daily driver headphones are the Airpods Pro. Love these things! The noise cancellation is great and the sound quality is amazing.</p>
    <h3>My Watch</h3>
    <p>As I use both Airpods and an iPhone so what watch do you think I use? That's right I use the Apple Watch Series 3.
    I love being able to track my movement, answer calls and texts, and so much more from the ease of my watch.</p>
    <h2>Storm Spotting</h2>
    <h3>My Camera</h3>
    <p>For my camera I use my mom's old Canon EOS 7D. Like I said it's pretty old but it's still really good.
    The pictures on my Storm Spotting page were taken with that camera.</p>
    <h3>Other Camera Gear</h3>
    <p>My tripod is well... a tripod. I don't know the brand or the price of it but its still a decent one.
    That's pretty much it.</p>
