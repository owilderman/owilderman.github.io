    <h2>My Loadout</h2>
    <h3>My Computer</h3>
    <p>So I use a lot of different things everyday, so here is my loadout, My computer is a 2012 MacBook Pro, with 240gb of storage, and 8gb of ram. This thing is a beast.
      Running macOS Catilina which isn't the latest version of macOS being almost 2 updates behind.
      While this thing is the bomb I will be upgrading it soon to the M1 MacBook. I don't know if I want the Air or the Pro, kinda depends what my friend gets.
      We call ourselves MacBros since we both have Macbooks and are friends and all that.
      With the M1 chip and the power of the upcoming macOS release Monterey that will be my powerhouse computer!</p>
    <h3>My Phone</h3>
    <p>My phone is the 128gb model of the the iPhone Xr. I love this thing,
      it's got great battery life letting me use it all day without charging
      it as long as I plug it in before I go to bed. Plus it's strong enough so that I dont have to use a case with out it breaking.
    </p>
    <h3>My Headphones</h3>
    <p>My daily driver headphones are the og Airpods. These things are great, even though they are kinda old, they still are amazing.
    When I need isolation heaphones I use the KZ es4's. They are super loud if I want them to be but I don't use them very loud at all.
    They do a great job at blocking out noise and keeping the music in my ears whereas my Airpods bleed noise a lot.</p>
    <h3>My Watch</h3>
    <p>As I use both Airpods, an iPhone, and a Macbook Pro, what watch do you think I use? That's right I use the Apple Watch Series 3.
    I love being able to track my movement, answer calls and texts, and so much more from the ease of my watch. And with the Assistive Touch that Apple announced at
    WWDC 21 being able to control my watch without even touching it will be amazing!</p>
    <h2>Storm Spotting</h2>
    <h3>My Camera</h3>
    <p>For my camera I use my mom's old Canon EOS 7D. Like I said it's pretty old but it's still really good.
    The pictures on my Storm Spotting page were taken with that camera.</p>
    <h3>Other Camera Gear</h3>
    <p>My tripod is well... a tripod. I don't know the brand or the price of it but its still a decent one.
    That's pretty much it.</p>
