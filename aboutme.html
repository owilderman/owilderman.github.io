  <h2>Who am I?</h2>
  <p>Hi! My name is Oliver Wilderman! I live in America with my family!
    I love programming and web design! I have a dog named Murray. He is a german shepard beagle mix.
    I have a brother and a sister. I live with my awesome parents. I love weather, programming,
    and hanging out with my dog.</p>
  <h3>Storm Chasing and Weather</h3>
  <p>I also plan on using this site to talk about my storm chases and upload video footage as well.
    Right now you can just click the little button on the top of the site to see what I'm doing now!</p>
  <h3>Programming</h3>
  <p>As I have said multiple times before I love programming and web design.
    If you want to see what projects I'm working on right now click the button at the top of the site labeled 'Programs'!</p>
  <h3>My hopes and dreams</h3>
  <h4>College</h4>
  <p>For college I want to study Computer Science and Meteorology. (I know who could've guessed?!)
    I also plan on doing general classes. The best part is that I don't have to pay for any of it because I have a full-ride scholarship!
    Amazing right?!</p>
  <h4>Life and Sweden</h4>
  <p>Once I get out of college I want to move to Sweden. I don't know why exactly but I've devleoped a fascination with Sweden.
    I love their people and their food is amazing too! My favorite part is the accent or mayeb the stunning views Sweden has to offer.
    Either way it's still an amazing place!</p>
