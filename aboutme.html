  <h2>Who am I?</h2>
  <p>Hi! My name is Oliver Wilderman! I live in America with my family!
    I love programming and web design! I have a dog named Murray. He is a german shepard beagle mix.
    I have a brother and a sister. I live with my awesome parents. I love weather, programming,
    and hanging out with my dog.</p>
  <h3>Storm Chasing and Weather</h3>
  <p>I also plan on using this site to talk about my storm chases and upload video footage as well.
    Right now you can just click the little button on the top of the site to see what I'm doing now!</p>
  <h4>College</h4>
  <p>For college I want to study Computer Science and Meteorology. (I know who could've guessed?!)
    I also plan on doing general classes. The best part is that I don't have to pay for any of it because I have a full-ride scholarship!
    Amazing right?!</p>
