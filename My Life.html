  <h2>What I'm doing now...</h2>
  <p>Once I have a job, have a car, and am able to drive I plan on getting a subaru forester. The 2010 model to be exact,
    I plan on putting in custom horns and tripods for cameras. I also want to put bulletproof glass for the windows and windshield.
  This will protect from hail, debris, and rocks that may hit my car.</p>
  <p>It's gonna be pretty sick!</p>
  <h2>My gear</h2>
  <p>So right now my current setup consists of my phone. I use the Iphone Xr. My current computer is a 2012 Macbook Pro with Mac OS Catalina. It's the best but its not the worst either. The battery life is awesome right now!</p>
  <h2>The steps ahead...</h2>
  <p>So right now I still need a camera and a car. I found a decent dslr camera on amazon with the right lense I need for about $600 dollars. As I have said before the car I want is a Subaru forester. I can usually get one of those for about $6000. With the job I have lined up I can get $12,000 a year. This would leave almost half of that for other upgrades like more computer stuff, Spotify (because spotify is a requirement),  and many other things like food and gas. Hopefully I will have most of that by sometime in 2022 (if not 2021!). I think I want to get the camera first that way I can work with what I got right now and seeing as it is only $600 it seems kinda worth it to start taking professional photos this spring and summer when the storms start rolling in where I live.
    this will leave plenty of time for me to get enough money for a car so I can start going further than my hometown for awesome storms.</p>
  <h2>Taking a step...</h2>
  <p>Alright, So I have a job now! $11.00 an hour pumpin gas! So in one year I'll make $12,000. This leaves plenty of money to buy all the junk I need!</p>
  <p>I will continue to keep this page updated as I buy more camera gear and go on more photo shoots. Stay Tuned!</p>
