  <h2>About Me!</h2>
  <p>Hi! My name is Oliver Wilderman but you probably already knew that.
    I'm 15 years old living in the United States.</p>
  <h2>My Interests</h2>
  <p>Over my life I have been interested in so many things. Right now I'm really intrigued by things like weather, music, programming, and computers.
  </p>
  <h2>What I do for Fun</h2>
  <p>For fun I like to hang out with my dog, Murray (see picture below), coding on my computer, listening to my playlist,
  talking to my friends.</p>
  <h2>My Loadout</h2>
  <h3>My Computer</h3>
  <p>So I use a lot of different things everyday, so here is my loadout, My computer is a 2012 MacBook Pro, with 240gb of storage, and 8gb of ram. This thing is a beast.
    Running macOS Catilina which isn't the latest version of macOS being almost 2 updates behind.
    While this thing is the bomb I will be upgrading it soon to the M1 MacBook Air.
    I can't wait so see the true power Apple has to offer.
    With the M1 chip and the power of the upcoming macOS release Monterey that will be my powerhouse computer!</p>
  <h3>My Phone</h3>
  <p>My phone is the 128gb model of the the iPhone Xr. I love this thing,
    it's got great battery life letting me use it all day without charging it as long as I plug it in before I go to bed.</p>
  <h3>My Headphones</h3>
  <p>My daily driver headphones are the og Airpods. These things are great, even though they are kinda old, they still are amazing.
  When I need isolation heaphones I use the KZ es4's. They are super loud if I want them to be but I don't use them very loud at all.
  They do a great job at blocking out noise and keeping the music in my ears whereas my Airpods bleed noise a lot.</p>
